# Study group OS

This repository will serve our study group for the university course "Operating systems". The main goal will be to become more familiar with C and making system calls with it. As most of my fellow students probably haven't used git yet, it'll hopefully be a nice learning experience to get to know it as well.

I hope to not only work on exercise material here, but maybe also some collaborative project like a game or something like that. That way getting to terms with C will hopefully be a bit more interesting :)
